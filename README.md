Building a Cricket Inning Score Predictor using Machine Learning and Streamlit 
Introduction
Predicting the final score of a cricket inning using machine learning techniques. Predicting cricket inning scores through machine learning offers improved team strategies, fan engagement, and data-driven insights. It aids in player performance evaluation, informs betting and fantasy sports decisions, and enhances media coverage and commentary. Despite its value, predictions should be seen as probabilities, considering cricket's dynamic nature and external influences. Technologies Used libraries and Models: Pandas, Numpy, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, XGB, XGBRegressor, Pipeline, Streamlit etc. Environment used: Jupyter Notebook, VScode Dataset and Data Preprocessing Data Collection: Gathering dataset from Kaggle which contains more then 1300+ matches data. Data Cleaning: Cleaning unwanted data columns so that it's become more efficient.
Data Transformation
 Transform the data to make it more suitable for analysis or modeling. Includes
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features to bring them to a similar scale, preventing certain features from dominating the analysis or model training. 
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. 
Feature Engineering: Create new features or extract meaningful information from existing features to improve the model's performance. 
Data Reduction: Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to improve computational efficiency and mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
Splitting Data: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This helps evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and prevents overfitting.
Handling Text and Categorical Data: Using one-hot encoding to convert them into a format suitable for analysis or model training.
Handling Missing Data: Using Median value to fill out missing values.
Documentation: Keep track of all the pre-processing step I've performed and document any changes made to the original data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
Detail the exploratory analysis I conducted using tools like pandas and Jupyter Notebook. Present key insights and visualizations that helped me understanding the dataset better. 
Model Development
 First I select Random Forest for prediction but the result isnâ€™t that much accurate then I tried XGBRegressor and this model give me great prediction and the benefit of using XGBRegressor is that it offers superior predictive performance due to its gradient boosting algorithm, effectively handling complex relationships in data, making it well-suited for accurate regression tasks in various domains.
Model Evaluation
 After completion of model I tried 15+ real world match data and this model's prediction is good enough to make the decision. 
Streamlit App Development
 Using Streamlit because it is a powerful tool for creating interactive web applications  I deployed this project using Streamlit Share hosting service because it's interface is user friendly and took less effort on creating app you just have to select your Github repository. 
Conclusion
 The creation of Score Predictor using advanced machine learning techniques and the interactive Streamlit platform signifies a significant stride in sports analytics. By harnessing the power of technologies like XGBRegressor and leveraging the capabilities of Streamlit Share for seamless deployment, this project not only empowers teams with strategic insights and enhances fan engagement but also underscores the potential of data-driven decision-making in the dynamic realm of cricket. As we embrace the predictive prowess of XGBRegressor and the user-friendly accessibility of Streamlit Share, this project stands as a testament to the convergence of technology and sports, offering a valuable tool for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and teams alike.
